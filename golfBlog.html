          Adding changes to the project exam was the most challenging part of
          this assignment. Luckily I received feedback on the exam in time for
          the delivery to make some extra changes. One of the first changes I
          made was adding box shadow on the posts on the index page, and on the
          white square both on the about and contact page. The about page was
          the only page I wasn't completely happy with, but after adding this it
          made the square more three dimensional and I liked how it turned out.

          For the posts inside the carousel on the landing page, I added a hover
          effect with a transition of 0.5 seconds that adds a couple of percent
          on the width of the post you are hovering on. This turned out great
          and makes it even easier to see what you are about to click, and that
          it is in fact clickable.
        </p>

          I had the logo inside a DIV, but I changed this to just be an anchor
          tag and styled it. On the contact page I also removed the p tag inside
          of the label. I also went over all of the javascript files to make
          sure I hadn't left any console logs or things i didnt need for the
          site to work.
