          The first thing I started with was cleaning up in the code. This
          includes removing console logs and files that i dont need after I
          switched to using an API call. One thing that I wanted to add to the
          site was different sort options for the jackets. I decided to add
          three radio buttons with the options of sorting the jackets after
          name, prices low to high, and prices high to low. I added
          eventlistener to these buttons and found a function that worked for
          names, and one for price on stackoverflow.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also decided to add a payment page for filling out card information
          and complete the payment. This was something I had received feedback
          on, and makes the site more realistic. I added a form with inputs for
          name, card number, expiry date and CVC code. I then validated the form
          using javascript. I also made the buttons smaller to make them look
          cleaner and better. Originally I had planned to rearrange the shopping
          cart to use local storage so that the user can add more jackets to the
          shopping cart. I struggled to find a solution of doing this with the
          setup I have for the shopping cart and ended up not having time to
          change the structure of the shopping cart and add it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last change I made to the site was adding box shaddow on some of
          the images to make them pop more from the white background. I also
          changed the title of the jacket details page to be the same as the
          name of the different jackets.
