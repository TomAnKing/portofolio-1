          The semester project was the project that needed the most work. One of
          the biggest problems was that I didn't have a navbar to easily
          navigate through the site. I only had a home button, so the user had
          to navigate through the landing page. Therefore creating a navbar was
          my first task. I added the navbar with links to all the different
          pages, and added a page containing all the exhibitions as well.
          Previously I have only used CSS for responsive hamburger menus on
          mobile view, but for this one I decided to create it using javascript.
          I found a tutorial on this, and apart from having to add an
          eventlistener with click on the hamburger, it was quite similar to the
          ones I had already made using CSS. In the tutorial they also had a
          nice transform changing the hamburger lines to an X when you click it.
        </p>
        <p>
          After learning how to dynamically create pages using javascript I
          decided to add a javascript file with an array containing all the
          information to each exhibition. Since I had the same styling for all
          the exhibitions this meant that I could delete a lot of unnecessary
          files. This cleaned up the project a lot. I would like to add them as
          posts on wordpress and fetch them from there, but with the project
          exam in for marking, I didn't want to take any risks of changing on
          the wordpress site.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also made some other changes such as adding box shadow to the posts
          to make them pop and changing the color on the front page from light
          grey, to an egg white color to have a better contrast with the blue
          text color.
